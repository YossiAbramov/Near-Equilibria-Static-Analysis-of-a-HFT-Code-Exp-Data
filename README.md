# Description
Supplementary information for Yossi Abramov's thesis that was done at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering under the supervision of Associate Professor Amir D. Gat. It contains the code used to derive the equations and includes the experimental data along with the code to generate the figures that compare experiments to theory. For more information, refer to the thesis.
# Contributors
- [Yossi Abramov](https://orcid.org/0009-0009-3157-326X) performed the theoretical work, conducted measurements for the model, compared the theory to experiments, and wrote the thesis along with the Mathematica file that contains the code and experimental data.
- [Ezra Ben-Abu](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7252-2965) conceived the research subject, manufactured the HFTs, and conducted measurements for the model. Moreover, he constructed the experimental setup and performed the measurements that were used to plot the experimental curves. He documented these measurements in the code.
